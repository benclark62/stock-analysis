# stock-analysis
Module 2 - VBA

### Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Our challenge was to leverage Microsoft Excel VBA to develop Macros that will enable us to quickly analyze large datasets to determine how well a stock performed during a given period. Using two years' worth of daily stock information, the primary metric to idenfity high- and low-performing stocks is their in-year return.  Understanding how often a stock is traded (Total Daily Volume) and percentage increase in price over the course of a year will be valuable inputs to making an informed investing decisionn.

Sample data

Return calculation

### Results: Using images and examples of your code

-- compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018

Output tables - show strong performance for full year in 2017 but poor performance in 2018

Line chart for all stocks showing that annual returns do not tell full story

Screen grabs of output tables for 2017 and 2018 - analyze differences between top / bottom performers

Show code for each calculation

-- Calculate volume for each ticke
-- Identify opening price
-- Identify closing price
-- Show return (closing / opening - 1)

-- compare the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Screen grabs of total run time between original script and refactored script - clean up images in PPT and save as .png

### Summary: Address the following questions.

-- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Advantages - much faster execution, more efficient = capable of working on larger datasets, understand intricacies of code by reviewing line-by-line
Disadvantages - time-consuming, could be unnecessary depending on dataset size (saved <1 second on this dataset)

-- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
